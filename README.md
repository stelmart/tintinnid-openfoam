# tintinnid-openfoam
OpenFOAM-based fluid mechanics project which simulates the feeding flows created by tintinnid zooplankton

This repository is part of my PhD work at UC Santa Cruz. It requires OpenFOAM in order to run.

This may be run as-is by typing the command

  sh retryAll.sh

into the terminal. Beware, though -- this runs a very large batch of simulations. It would also email me every time a simulation is complete, so modify retryAll.sh accordingly.

More to come...
